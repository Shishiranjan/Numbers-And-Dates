//You can easily be able to do all of the mathematical operations in JS like addition, subtractio,
//multiplication, division etc.
//For finding the square root of any number simply, use the sqrt method of math.
console.log(math.sqrt(81));
//Alternative way for finding the square root of any  number.

console.log(64 ** (1 / 2));
// But to find the cubic root of any method there is no any method in javascript. But the alternative of
//doing it is given below.

console.log(1000 ** (1 / 3));

//For finding the maximum value from a list of numbers.
console.log(Math.max(14, 15, 16, 25, 71, 11));

//For finding the minimum element from a list of numbers.

console.log(Math.min(78, 14, 75, 52, 67, 19));

//To find the value of pi just use PImethod.
console.log(Math.PI);

//Finding the area of circle

console.log(Math.PI * Number.parseFloat("10px") ** 2);
